# titanic_survival_prediction
***The basic prediction model with Titanic dataset..***

**Problem Statement:**

The Titanic dataset provides information on the fate of the passengers on the Titanic, summarized according to economic status, sex, age and survival. </br>

Our task is to predict the survival of the Titanic passengers.. Let's install the libraries we need..

When you complete this notebook you can able to understand as follow;

1. Data Exploration, Performed missing datas check and how can you deal with these

2. Which features are important and how can you check those with HeatMap

3. If we have categorical features, how can we convert into numeric ones?

4. How can built a classfier to predict survival?

5. lastly, how can we evaluate the performance of our models using the classification report, confusion matrix etc.

Good work!
